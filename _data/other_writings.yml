    title: "Can we infer social preferences from the lab? Evidence from the trust game"
    authors: "Nicole Baran and Luigi Zingales"
    date: "August 2009"
    type: "Working Paper"
    pdf: "assets/papers/Social Preferences.pdf"
    abstract: "We show that a measure of reciprocity derived from the Berg et al. (1995) trust game in a laboratory setting predicts the reciprocal behavior of the same subjects in a real-world situation. By using the Crowne and Marlowe (1960) social desirability scale, we do not find any evidence that a desire to conform to social norms distorts results in the lab, yet we do find evidence that it affects results in the field."

    title: "The Cost of Banking Regulation"
    authors: "Luigi Guiso and Luigi Zingales"
    date: "February 2007"
    type: "Working Paper"
    pdf: "assets/papers/costofregulation.pdf"
    abstract: "We use exogenous variation in the degree of restrictions to bank competition across Italian provinces to study both the effects of bank regulation and the impact of deregulation. We find that where entry was more restricted the cost of credit was higher and - contrary to expectations- access to credit lower. The only benefit of these restrictions was a lower proportion of bad loans. Liberalization brings a reduction in rate spreads and an increased access to credit at the cost of an increase in bad loans. In provinces where restrictions to bank competition were most severe, the proportion of bad loans after deregulation raises above the level present in more competitive markets, suggesting that the pre-existing conditions severely impact the effect of liberalizations."
