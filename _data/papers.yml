  title: Embedded Culture as a Source of Comparative Advantage
  pdf:assets/papers/cultureHandbook.pdf
  authors: Luigi Guiso and Luigi Zingales
  journal: Handbook of Culture and Economic Behavior
  date: Forthcoming
  abstract: This paper examines how the concept of embedded culture played a transformative role in the ongoing cultural revolution within economics and business.  We trace the field's shift from the 20th-century concept of homo economicus universalis to an approach incorporating cultural embeddedness in economic behavior. Beyond documenting this intellectual transformation, we identify fertile areas for future research and explore how an embedded cultural perspective can enhance both our understanding of economic phenomena and the design of effective policies.

  title: Overconfidence and Preferences for Competition

  Appendix: assets/papers/AppendixPreferenceCompetition.pdf
  authors: Ernesto Reuben and Luigi Zingales
  journal: Journal of Finance
  date: April 2024
  pages: 1087-1121
  abstract: We study whether and when preferences for competition are a positive economic
    trait among high-earners and to what extent this trait can explain the gender
    gap in income among MBAs. Consistent with the experimental evidence, preferences
    for competition are a positive economic trait only for non-overconfident individuals.
    Preferences for competition correlate with income only at graduation when bonuses
    are guaranteed and not a function of performance. Overconfident, competitionloving
    MBAs have lower compensation and income growth, and experience greater exit from
    high-reward industries and more frequent job interruptions. Preferences for competition
    do not explain the gender pay gap among MBAs.

  pages: 972-1006
  abstract: We study the effect of exposure to immigrants on the educational outcomes
    of U.S.-born students, using a unique dataset combining population-level birth
    and school records from Florida. This research question is complicated by substantial
    school selection of U.S.-born students, especially among White and comparatively
    affluent students, in response to the presence of immigrant students in the school.
    We propose a new identification strategy, comparing sibling outcomes with the
    inclusion of family fixed effects, to partial out the unobserved non-random selection
    of native-born families into schools. We find that the presence of immigrant students
    has a positive effect on the academic achievement of U.S.-born students, especially
    for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Moreover, the presence of immigrants
    does not negatively affect the performance of affluent U.S.-born students, who
    typically show a higher academic achievement compared to immigrant students. We
    provide suggestive evidence on potential channels.

  authors: Decio Coviello, Erika Deserrano, and Nicola Persico
  journal: The Journal of Law, Economics & Organization
  date: September 2022
  abstract: We study the causal effect of mood on the productivity of call-center
    workers. Mood is measured through an online "mood questionnaire" which the workers
    are encouraged to fill out daily. We find that better mood actually decreases
    worker productivity for workers whose compensation is largely fixed. The negative
    effect of mood is attenuated for workers whose compensation is based on performance
    (high-powered incentives). This finding holds both at a correlational level and
    in two IV settings, where mood is instrumented for by weather, or, alternatively,
    by whether the local professional sports team played/won the day before. We rule
    out a number of threats to the exclusion restrictions, and discuss the mechanisms
    that could generate our findings.

  pages: 175-188
  abstract: We study the effect of preferences for boys on the performance in mathematics
    of girls, using evidence from two different data sources. In our first set of
    results, we identify families with a preference for boys by using fertility stopping
    rules in a large population of households whose children attend public schools
    in Florida. Girls growing up in a boy-biased family score on average 3 percentage
    points lower on math tests when compared to girls raised in other types of families.
    In our second set of results, we find similar effects when we study the correlations
    between girlsï¿½ performance in mathematics and maternal gender role attitudes,
    using evidence from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We conclude that
    socialization at home can explain a non-trivial part of the observed gender disparities
    in mathematics performance and document that maternal gender attitudes correlate
    with those of their children, supporting the hypothesis that preferences transmitted
    through the family impact children behavior.

  authors: John M. Barrios, Efraim Benmelech, Yael V. Hochberg, and Luigi Zingales
  journal: Journal of Public Economics
  date: January 2021
  abstract: Using mobile phone and survey data, we show that during the early phases
    of COVID-19, voluntary social distancing was greater in areas with higher civic
    capital and amongst individuals exhibiting a higher sense of civic duty. This
    effect is robust to including controls for political ideology, income, age, education,
    and other local-level characteristics. This result is present for U.S. individuals
    and U.S. counties as well as European regions. Moreover, we show that after U.S.
    states began re-opening, high civic capital counties maintained a more sustained
    level of social distancing, while low civic capital counties did not. Finally,
    we show that U.S. individuals report a higher tendency to use protective face
    masks in high civic capital counties. Our evidence points to the importance of
    considering the level of civic capital in designing public policies not only in
    response to pandemics, but also more generally.

    grade reading and math, have larger test score gains over time, fewer absences
    and disciplinary incidents, are less likely to repeat grades, more likely to enroll
    in advanced high school courses and more likely to graduate from high school in

    for their children and social learning from peers are important mechanisms. (JEL

    we test whether investors' risk aversion increases following the 2008 crisis.
    We find that, after the crisis, both qualitative and quantitative measures of
    risk aversion increase substantially and that affected individuals divest more
    from stock. We investigate four explanations: changes in wealth, expected income,
    perceived probabilities, and emotion-based changes of the utility function. Our
    data are inconsistent with the first two channels, while they suggest that fear
    is a potential mechanism underlying financial decisions, whether by increasing
    the curvature of the utility function or the salience of negative outcomes.

  abstract: We study whether a positive historical shock can generate long-term persistence
    in development. We show that Italian cities that achieved self-government in the
    Middle Ages have a higher level of civic capital today than similar cities in
    the same area that did not. The size of this effect increases with the length
    of the period of independence and its intensity. This effect persists even after
    accounting for the fact that cities did not become independent randomly. We conjecture
    that the Middle-Age experience of self-government fostered self-efficacy beliefs
    in one's own ability to complete tasks and reach goals and this positive attitude,
    transmitted across generations, enhances civic capital today. Consistently, we
    find that fifth-graders in former free city-states exhibit stronger self-efficacy
    beliefs and that these beliefs are correlated with a higher level of civic capital.

  abstract: Entering a currency union without any political union European countries
    have taken a gamble: will the needs of the currency unions force a political integration
    (as anticipated by Monnet) or will the tensions create a backlash, as suggested
    by Kaldor, Friedman and many others? We try to answer this question by analyzing
    the cross sectional and time series variation in pro-European sentiments in the
    EU 15 countries. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty seems to have reduced the pro-Europe
    sentiment as does the 2010 Eurozone crisis. Yet, in spite of the worst recession
    in recent history, the Europeans still support the common currency. Europe seems
    trapped: there is no desire to go backward, no interest in going forward, but
    it is economically unsustainable to stay still.

  abstract: While both cultural and legal norms (institutions) help foster cooperation,
    culture is the more primitive of the two and itself sustains formal institutions.
    Cultural changes are rarer and slower than changes in legal institutions, which
    makes it difficult to identify the role played by culture. Cultural changes and
    their effects are easier to identify in simpler, more controlled, environments,
    such as corporations. Corporate culture, thus, is not only interesting per se,
    but also as a laboratory to study the role of societal culture and the way it
    can be changed.

    to sustain integrity as a corporate value. We find that publicly traded firms
    are less able to sustain it. Traditional measures of corporate governance do not
    seem to have much of an impact.

  abstract: We use a combination of lab and field evidence to study whether highly-impatient
    individuals are more likely to procrastinate. To measure impatience, we elicit
    individual discount rates by giving participants choices between smaller-sooner
    and larger-later rewards. To measure procrastination, we record how fast participants
    complete three tasks: an online game, their application to the university, and
    a mandatory survey. We find that, consistent with the theory, impatient individuals
    procrastinate more, but only in tasks where there are costs to delay (the online
    game and university application). Since we paid participants by check to control
    for transaction costs, we are also able to determine whether the participantsï¿½
    cashing behavior is consistent with the timing of their payment choice. We find
    substantial evidence of time inconsistency. Namely, more than half of the participants
    who received their check straight away instead of waiting two weeks for a reasonably
    larger amount, subsequently took more than two weeks to cash it.

  authors: Ernesto Reuben and Luigi Zingales
  journal: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  date: 2014
  volume: 111(12)
  pages: 4403-4408
  abstract: Women outnumber men in undergraduate enrollments, but they are much less
    likely than men to major in mathematics or science or to choose a profession in
    these fields. This outcome often is attributed to the effects of negative sex-based
    stereotypes. We studied the effect of such stereotypes in an experimental market,
    where subjects were hired to perform an arithmetic task that, on average, both
    genders perform equally well. We find that without any information other than
    a candidate's appearance (which makes sex clear), both male and female subjects
    are twice more likely to hire a man than a woman. The discrimination survives
    if performance on the arithmetic task is self-reported, because men tend to boast
    about their performance, whereas women generally underreport it. The discrimination
    is reduced, but not eliminated, by providing full information about previous performance
    on the task. By using the Implicit Association Test, we show that implicit stereotypes
    are responsible for the initial average bias in sex-related beliefs and for a
    bias in updating expectations when performance information is self-reported. That
    is, employers biased against women are less likely to take into account the fact
    that men, on average, boast more than women about their future performance, leading
    to suboptimal hiring choices that remain biased in favor of men.

  abstract: We use survey data to measure householdsï¿½ propensity to default on mortgages
    even if they can afford to pay them (strategic default) when the value of the
    mortgage exceeds the value of the house. The willingness to default increases
    both in the absolute and in the relative size of the home-equity shortfall. Our
    evidence suggests that this willingness is affected both by pecuniary and non-pecuniary
    factors, such as views about fairness and morality. We also find that exposure
    to other people who strategically defaulted increases the propensity to default
    strategically because it conveys information about the probability of being sued.

  abstract: The World Values Survey (WVS) question on trust has been widely used to
    study the economic effect of trust. Recent work, however, questions its validity
    as an accurate measure of trust by showing that it is not correlated with the
    senderï¿½s behaviour in the Berg et al. trust game. What measure then should we
    trust to measure trust? In this article, we argue that the senderï¿½s behaviour
    in a trust game is driven both by beliefs and by preferences. In contrast, WVS-like
    measures capture mostly the belief based component of a trust game.

  abstract: We present evidence from an experiment in which groups select a leader
    to compete against the leaders of other groups in a real-effort task that they
    have all performed in the past. We find that women are selected much less often
    as leaders than is suggested by their individual past performance. We study three
    potential explanations for the underrepresentation of women, namely, gender differences
    in overconfidence concerning past performance, in the willingness to exaggerate
    past performance to the group, and in the reaction to monetary incentives. We
    find that men's overconfidence is the driving force behind the observed prevalence
    of male representation.

    abstract: This chapter reviews the recent debate about the role of social capital in economics. We argue that all the difficulties this concept has encountered in economics are due to a vague and excessively broad definition. For this reason, we restrict social capital to the set of values and beliefs that help cooperationâwhich for clarity we label civic capital. We argue that this definition differentiates social capital from human capital and satisfies the properties of the standard notion of capital. We then argue that civic capital can explain why differences in economic performance persist over centuries and discuss how the effect of civic capital can be distinguished empirically from other variables that affect economic performance and its persistence, including institutions and geography.

  abstract: We compare the trading performance of independent directors and other

    abnormal returns when they purchase their company stock, and that the difference
    with the same firm's officers is relatively small at most horizons. The results
    are robust to controlling for firm-fixed effects and to using a variety of alternative
    specifications. Executive officers and independent directors make higher returns
    in firms with the weakest governance and the gap between these two groups widens
    in such firms. Independent directors who sit on the audit committee earn higher
    returns than other independent directors at the same firm. Finally, independent
    directors earn significantly higher returns than the market when they sell the
    company stock in a window before bad news and around earnings restatements.

  journal: The Quarterly Journal of Economics
  volume: 124(3)
  pages: 1095-1131
  abstract: How much do cultural biases affect economic exchange? We try to answer
    this question by using data on bilateral trust between European countries. We
    document that this trust is affected not only by the characteristics of the country
    being trusted, but also by cultural aspects of the match between trusting country
    and trusted country, such as religion, history of conflicts, and genetic and somatic
    similarities. We then find that lower bilateral trust leads to less trade between
    two countries, less portfolio investment, and less direct investment, even after
    controlling for the characteristics of the two countries. This effect is stronger
    for goodsthat are more trust intensive. Our results suggest that perceptions rooted
    in culture are important (and generally omitted) determinants of economic exchange.

  abstract: We evaluate the impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) on shareholders
    by studying the lobbying behavior of investors and corporate insiders in order
    to affect the final implemented rules under SOX. Investors lobbied overwhelmingly
    in favor of strict implementation of SOX, while corporate insiders and business
    groups lobbied against strict implementation. We identify firms most affected
    by the law as those whose insiders lobbied against strict implementation. Such
    firms appear to be characterized by agency problems, rather than motivated by
    concerns over compliance costs. Cumulative stock returns during the five and a
    half months leading up to SOX passage were approximately 7% higher for corporations
    whose insiders lobbied against SOX disclosure-related provisions than for similar
    non-lobbying firms, consistent with an expectation that SOX would reduce agency
    problems. Analysis of returns in the post-passage implementation period suggests
    that investors' positive expectations with regards to the effects of these provisions
    were warranted.

  abstract: We test a catering theory describing how stock market mispricing might
    influence individual firmsï¿½ investment decisions. We use discretionary accruals
    as our proxy for mispricing. We find a positive relation between abnormal investment
    and discretionary accruals; that abnormal investment is more sensitive to discretionary
    accruals for firms with higher R&D intensity (opaque firms) or share turnover
    (firms with shorter shareholder horizons); that firms with high abnormal investment
    subsequently have low stock returns; and that the larger the relative price premium,
    the stronger the abnormal return predictability. We show that patterns in abnormal
    returns are stronger for firms with higher R&D intensity or share turnover.

  volume: 63(6)
  pages: 2557-2600
  abstract: We study the effect that a general lack of trust can have on stock market
    participation. In deciding whether to buy stocks, investors factor in the risk
    of being cheated. The perception of this risk is a function not only of the objective
    characteristics of the stocks, but also of the subjective characteristics of the
    investor. Less trusting individuals are less likely to buy stock and, conditional
    on buying stock, they will buy less. We find evidence consistent with these propositions
    in Dutch and Italian micro data, as well as in cross country data. All the evidence
    suggests that lack of trust could be an important factor in explaining the limited
    participation puzzle, especially among more wealthy investors.

  abstract: To explain the extremely long-term persistence (more than 500 years) of
    positive historical experiences of cooperation (Putnam 1993), we model the intergenerational
    transmission of priors about the trustworthiness of others. We show that this
    transmission tends to be biased toward excessively conservative priors. As a result,
    societies can be trapped in a low-trust equilibrium. In this context, a temporary
    shock to the return to trusting can have a permanent effect on the level of trust.
    We validate the model by testing its predictions on the World Values Survey data
    and the German Socio Economic Panel. We also present some anecdotal evidence that
    these priors are reflected in novels that originate in different parts of the
    country.

  abstract: We study the effects of differences in local financial development within
    an integrated financial market. To do so, we construct a new indicator of financial
    development by estimating a regional effect on the probability that, ceteris paribus,
    a household is shut off from the credit market. By using this indicator we find
    that financial development enhances the probability an individual starts his own
    business, favors entry, increases competition, and promotes growth of firms. As
    predicted by theory, these effects are weaker for larger firms, which can more
    easily raise funds outside of the local area. Overall, the results suggest local
    financial development is an important determinant of the economic success of an
    area even in an environment where there are no frictions to capital movements.

  abstract: This paper uses information on individual loan contracts to study the
    effects of government ownership on bank lending behavior. State-owned banks charge
    lower interest rates than do privately owned banks to similar or identical firms,
    even if firms are able to borrow more from privately owned banks. State-owned
    banks mostly favor large firms and firms located in depressed areas. The lending
    behavior of state-owned banks is affected by the electoral results of the party
    affiliated with the bank: the stronger the political party in the area where the
    firm is borrowing, the lower the interest rates charged.

  abstract: Since Max Weber, there has been an active debate on the impact of religion
    on peopleï¿½s economic attitudes. Much of the existing evidence, however, is based
    on cross-country studies in which this impact is confounded by differences in
    other institutional factors. We use the World Values Surveys to identify the relationship
    between intensity of religious beliefs and economic attitudes, controlling for
    country fixed effects. We study several economic attitudes toward cooperation,
    the government, working women, legal rules, thriftiness, and the market economy.
    We also distinguish across religious denominations, differentiating on whether
    a religion is dominant in a country. We find that on average, religious beliefs
    are associated with "good" economic attitudes, where "good" is defined as conducive
    to higher per capita income and growth. Yet religious people tend to be more racist
    and less favorable with respect to working women. These effects differ across
    religious denominations. Overall, we find that Christian religions are more positively
    associated with attitudes conducive to economic growth.

  title: The Effects of Banking Mergers on Loan Contracts

  abstract: This paper studies the effects of banking mergers on individual loan borrowers.
    Using information on individual loan contracts between banks and companies, I
    analyze the consequences of banking consolidation on banks' credit policies. I
    find that (i) in-market mergers are beneficial to borrowers if these mergers involve
    the acquisition of banks with small market shares. In these cases, interest rates
    charged by the consolidated banks decrease, consistently with the view that horizontal
    mergers generate efficiency gains. However, as the local market share of the acquired
    bank increases, the efficiency effect is offset by market power; (ii) mergers
    have different distributional effects across borrowers of different sizes; (iii)
    small borrowers of target banks are less likely to borrow in the future from the
    consolidated bank than borrowers of similar banks not involved in mergers. The
    decision to deny credit to small borrowers does not seem to be based on the quality
    of the borrower, confirming potential adverse welfare effects of the banking consolidation
    on the availability of credit to small businesses.
