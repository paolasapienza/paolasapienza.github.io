    This file is problematic, 1 to 3 are actually replication packages (I have now linked to the journal sites). 4 is only data: it should be
    Dataset for paper "Long-Term Persistence," Journal of the European Economic Association, 2016 (data download)
    
    Similarly for 5: Dataset for paper "The Role of Social Capital in Financial Development," American Economic Review, 94(3): 526-556 (data download)
    
    
    6 and 7 are referred to the same paper ""Cultural Biases in Economic Exchange?", I can only distribute a subset of the data because the rest is proprietary
    The first entry (6) is one variable "somatic distance"
    Somatic distance dataset from the paper "Cultural Biases in Economic Exchange?," The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 124(3), August 2009. (data download)
    
    The second entry (7) is (non-copyrighted) Data to reconstruct Table 3 in "Cultural Biases in Economic Exchange?," The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 124(3), August 2009. (data download)
